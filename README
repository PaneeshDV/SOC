From the start of project to Checkpoint1:
  I learned html,css in the first week and made a webpage Mario which I attached code files in the repo.
  In the second and third weeks I learned JavaScript and completed the task of making stopwatch I also committed the code files of stop watch.
  
From checkpoint1 to checkpoint2:
  In this duration only the material of Angular was released due to postponed midsems of freshies and starting of endsems.
  In this gap I learned more Javascript.
  I completed the videos to be watched and implemented those to my codes.
  I made a Todo-list app while learnning Angular as directed in the videos.
